-1. **Confirm that, after loading the image with stbi_load, you've immediately written it out with stbi_write_png or similar, and that version of the image is wrong.** If it displays wrong in a program you're writing, it could be your display code. For example, people writing OpenGL programs frequently do not upload or display the image correctly and blame stb_image for it.
+1. **Confirm that, after loading the image with stbi_load, you've immediately written it out with stbi_write_png or similar, and that version of the image is also wrong.** If it is correct when written out, the problem is not in stb_image. If it displays wrong in a program you're writing, it's probably your display code. For example, people writing OpenGL programs frequently do not upload or display the image correctly and assume stb_image is at fault even though writing out the image demonstrates that it loads correctly.
 
 2. *Provide an image that does not load correctly using stb_image* so we can reproduce the problem.
