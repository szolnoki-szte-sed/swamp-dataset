+# Maintainer wanted!
+This project has a ton of people using it, but I (@jaredly) haven't used Hexo in several years. If you use this plugin, and are interested in helping maintain it, I'd love your help! To volunteer, start making pull requests fixing bugs & making things better :) if I'm not responsive, feel free to bug me on twitter (@jaredforsyth).
