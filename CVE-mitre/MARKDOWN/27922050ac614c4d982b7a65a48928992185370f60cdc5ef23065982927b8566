 This change has been done to avoid Traefik instances with the default configuration to be hanging forever while waiting for bytes to be read on the connection.
 
-We suggest to adapt this value accordingly to your situation, as the new default value is purposely narrowed,
-it can make the connection be closed too early.

 Increasing the `readTimeout` value could be the solution notably if you are dealing with the following errors:
 
 - TCP: `Error while handling TCP connection: readfrom tcp X.X.X.X:X->X.X.X.X:X: read tcp X.X.X.X:X->X.X.X.X:X: i/o timeout`
