-In the following pseudocode, the attacker makes two simultaneous calls of the program, CALLER-1 and CALLER-2. Both callers are for the same user account.CALLER-1 (the attacker) is associated with PROGRAM-1 (the instance that handles CALLER-1). CALLER-2 is associated with PROGRAM-2.CALLER-1 makes a transfer request of 80.00.PROGRAM-1 calls GetBalanceFromDatabase and sets $balance to 100.00PROGRAM-1 calculates $newbalance as 20.00, then calls SendNewBalanceToDatabase().Due to high server load, the PROGRAM-1 call to SendNewBalanceToDatabase() encounters a delay.CALLER-2 makes a transfer request of 1.00.PROGRAM-2 calls GetBalanceFromDatabase() and sets $balance to 100.00. This happens because the previous PROGRAM-1 request was not processed yet.PROGRAM-2 determines the new balance as 99.00.After the initial delay, PROGRAM-1 commits its balance to the database, setting it to 20.00.PROGRAM-2 sends a request to update the database, setting the balance to 99.00
